# Data Analysis Project

## Introduction
This project demonstrates a step-by-step approach to data analysis, including data collection, loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, preprocessing, splitting, and visualization.

## Steps

### ðŸ”œ 1. Define the Problem
Identify the objective and goals of the analysis.
- **Objective**: Understand the dataset and prepare it for predictive modeling.
- **Goals**: Clean the data, perform EDA, and prepare the data for model training.


### ðŸ”œ 2. Data Collection
Gather data from relevant sources.
- **Source**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/rollercoaster-database
- **Description**: Brief description of the dataset and its features.

### ðŸ”œ 3. Data Loading
Load the data into a suitable format (e.g., CSV, Excel, database).
- Ensure the data is loaded correctly for further analysis.

There is data with little exploration: [Understand Basics](DataUnderstanding.py).


### 4. ðŸ”œ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Understand the structure and content of the data using summary statistics and visualizations.
- **Summary Statistics**: Analyze basic statistical properties of the data.
- **Visualizations**: Use plots to explore data distribution and relationships.

### 5. ðŸ”œ Data Cleaning
Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct data types.
- **Missing Values**: Decide on strategies to handle missing data.
- **Duplicates**: Identify and remove duplicate entries.
- **Data Types**: Ensure all data types are correctly assigned.

### 6.ðŸ”œ  Data Preprocessing
Normalize or standardize data, encode categorical variables, and perform feature engineering.
- **Normalization/Standardization**: Prepare numerical data for modeling.
- **Categorical Encoding**: Convert categorical variables into numerical format.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features to improve model performance.

### 7. ðŸ”œ Data Splitting
Split the data into training and testing sets.
- **Training Set**: Used to train the model.
- **Testing Set**: Used to evaluate the model's performance.

### 8.ðŸ”œ  Data Visualization
Visualize data to identify patterns and insights using plots like histograms, scatter plots, and box plots.
- **Histograms**: Analyze the distribution of numerical features.
- **Scatter Plots**: Explore relationships between features.
- **Box Plots**: Examine the spread and outliers in the data.

## ðŸ”œ  Next Steps
The data is now clean and ready for model selection and prediction. In the next steps, we will:
- Choose appropriate machine learning models.
- Train the models on the training data.
- Evaluate model performance using various metrics.
- Fine-tune model parameters to improve performance.
- Make predictions on the testing data.
- Deploy the model for production use.

Stay tuned for further updates, Happy Coding!
